Evaluating Ames Housing Prices

Tasked with predicting the Ames, IA housing prices, we begin with some exploratory data analysis.
There are 80 columns in the imported data set, many of which are categorical, and many of which have a surprising amount of null values. When evaluating a correlation matrix, we see that there are a few instances of collinearity. Two pairs of offenders are 1stFlrSF and TotalBsmtSF and GarageCars and GarageArea. I dropped GarageCars and TotalBsmtSF. It is also pretty clear that the various areas contained in different variables could be contained to make a total area, so I went ahead and did that as well. After looking at the coefficients in the correlation table, I decided to focus on those that stand out and are intuitively linked to price. These include but are not limited to Overal Quality, Total SF, Bedrooms, Lot size, Fireplaces, YR Built, etc.

This served as the basis for all of my models, with the only differences between them some feature engineering and dummifying of neighborhood. After setting up the variables and codifying the categorical columns, I imputed the column mean onto any null values in any given column. For all of the models I used multivariate linear regression. I was unfortunately only able to get my model close to 35000 root mean squared error, which is less than one half of a standard deviation of the sale price; however, it is not what I would have liked. I tried transforming some of the variables using standardscalars in my feature engineering, but had a difficult time implementing them to render a better rmse. I was concerned with overfitting from the onset, so I tried to always limit the amount of features I used in my model. In retrospect, however, I probably should have dummified a few more categorical columns, additionally I would have liked to have done more with polynomials, as well as taking a basic logarithmic linear regression to use for comparison.


The coefficients my model came up with were 1.99357830e+04 for 'Overall Qual',   1.22826102e+01 for 'Total SF',  2.38468291e+02 for 'Year Built',  3.43944453e+02 for 'Year Remod/Add', 7.35356505e+01 for 'Garage Yr Blt',  1.41539040e+02 for 'Full Bath',  3.53915305e+03 for 'TotRms AbvGrd',  1.12093246e+04 for 'Fireplaces', 4.30122185e+04 for 'NridgHt', -2.90752978e+01 for 'Lot Frontage',  3.68743437e+00 for 'Open Porch SF',  1.56266393e+00 for 'Lot Area'. Perhaps most surprisingly was the strong relationship between fireplaces and sale price.

For investment opportunities, I would suggest tailoring your budget to the neighborhood, as there was a strong relationship between certain neighborhoods, while others did not affect price as much. It would be wise then to focus on good value homes, which would be found as some combination of older home in less desirable neighborhoods with moderate square footage. None of which is surprising particularly, but be prepared to pay a premium for a fireplace.
